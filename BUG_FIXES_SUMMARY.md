# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Votes Not Being Read Correctly from Supabase Table

**Problem:** Launches were showing incorrect vote counts (e.g., 0 votes when there were actually votes in the database).

**Root Cause:** The `votes_count` field in the launches table was out of sync with the actual votes in the votes table. This can happen if:
- The database triggers weren't properly set up
- Votes were added/removed before triggers were created
- Manual database operations bypassed the triggers

**Solution:**
- Created a SQL script (`fix-vote-counts.sql`) to recalculate all vote counts from the votes table
- The script updates the `votes_count` field to match the actual count of votes

**Action Required:**
Run the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
UPDATE launches
SET votes_count = (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM votes
  WHERE votes.launch_id = launches.id
);
```

**Files Modified:** 
- Created: `fix-vote-counts.sql`

### 2. ✅ Views Counting for Project Launches

**Problem:** Views were being incremented but the displayed count was always one behind the actual count.

**Root Cause:** The view count was being incremented AFTER fetching the launch data, so the local state showed the old count.

**Solution:**
- Modified `app/launch/[id]/page.tsx` to increment the view count immediately after fetching
- Updated the local state to reflect the incremented count before displaying

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// Before: View count was incremented but not reflected in state
await supabase.from('launches').update({ views_count: data.views_count + 1 })
setLaunch(data) // Shows old count

// After: View count is incremented and reflected in state
const { error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('launches')
  .update({ views_count: data.views_count + 1 })
  .eq('slug', launchSlug)

if (!updateError) {
  data.views_count = data.views_count + 1 // Update local data
}
setLaunch(data) // Shows new count
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/launch/[id]/page.tsx`

---

### 3. ✅ Profile Page ReferenceError

**Problem:** Going to `/profile/[username]` showed "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred" with console error: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'I' before initialization`

**Root Cause:** Function hoisting issue - the `checkUser` function was being called before it was defined in the code, causing a temporal dead zone error.

**Solution:**
- Moved the `checkUser` function definition BEFORE the `fetchProfile` function
- This ensures proper function hoisting and eliminates the initialization error

**Changes Made:**
Reordered functions in `app/profile/[username]/page.tsx`:
```typescript
// Before: checkUser was defined after fetchProfile and loading check
const fetchProfile = async () => { ... }
if (loading) { ... }
const checkUser = async () => { ... }

// After: checkUser is defined before fetchProfile
const checkUser = async () => { ... }
const fetchProfile = async () => { ... }
if (loading) { ... }
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/profile/[username]/page.tsx`

---

### 4. ✅ Favicon Not Displaying in Browser Tab

**Problem:** Browser tab showed the default globe icon instead of the DubLaunch logo.

**Root Cause:** Next.js 14 with App Router requires specific file naming and location for favicons. The metadata configuration in `layout.tsx` wasn't sufficient.

**Solution:**
- Created `app/icon.svg` - Next.js automatically uses this as the favicon
- Created `app/favicon.ico` placeholder (should be replaced with actual .ico file)
- Removed the manual `icons` configuration from metadata in `layout.tsx`

**Files Created:**
- `app/icon.svg` - SVG icon with DubLaunch branding (purple-blue gradient with "D")
- `app/favicon.ico` - Placeholder (needs to be replaced with actual .ico file)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/layout.tsx` - Removed manual icons configuration

**Note:** For best results, you should:
1. Convert your `public/logo.svg` or `public/logo.png` to a proper `.ico` file
2. Replace the placeholder `app/favicon.ico` with the actual .ico file
3. You can use online tools like https://favicon.io/ to generate proper favicon files

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes, verify:

- [ ] Run the `fix-vote-counts.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify vote counts are correct on all launches
- [ ] Check that views increment correctly when visiting launch pages
- [ ] Navigate to user profiles (e.g., `/profile/username`) and verify no errors
- [ ] Check browser tab shows DubLaunch icon instead of default globe
- [ ] Test voting on launches to ensure counts update correctly
- [ ] Test viewing launches to ensure view counts increment

## Additional Notes

### Database Triggers
Make sure these triggers are active in your Supabase database:
- `trigger_update_vote_count_add` - Increments votes_count when a vote is added
- `trigger_update_vote_count_remove` - Decrements votes_count when a vote is removed

You can verify by running:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE '%vote%';
```

### Favicon Best Practices
For production, generate a complete favicon set including:
- `favicon.ico` (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
- `icon.svg` (vector, scales to any size)
- `apple-icon.png` (180x180 for iOS)
- `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` (for PWA)

Place these in the `app` directory and Next.js will handle them automatically.
