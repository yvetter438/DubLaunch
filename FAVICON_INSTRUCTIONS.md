# Favicon Setup Instructions

## Current Status
✅ Created `app/icon.svg` - This will work as a favicon in modern browsers

## For Complete Favicon Support

To add full favicon support across all browsers and devices, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Use an Online Generator (Recommended)

1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
2. Upload your `public/logo.png` or `public/logo.svg`
3. Download the generated favicon package
4. Extract and copy `favicon.ico` to the `app` directory

### Option 2: Manual Creation

If you have image editing software:

1. Create a 32x32 pixel version of your logo
2. Save it as `favicon.ico` in the `app` directory
3. Optionally create additional sizes (16x16, 48x48) and include them in the .ico file

### Option 3: Use ImageMagick (Command Line)

If you have ImageMagick installed:

```bash
# From the project root
convert public/logo.png -resize 32x32 app/favicon.ico
```

## File Structure

After setup, your `app` directory should have:
```
app/
  ├── icon.svg          ✅ Already created (SVG icon)
  └── favicon.ico       ⚠️  Needs to be added
```

## Testing

After adding the favicon:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Visit http://localhost:3000
4. Check the browser tab for your logo

## Notes

- Next.js 14 automatically detects and uses `icon.svg` and `favicon.ico` from the `app` directory
- No additional configuration needed in `layout.tsx`
- The `icon.svg` file I created has a purple-blue gradient with a "D" - you may want to replace it with your actual logo
